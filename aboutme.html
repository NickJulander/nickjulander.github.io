        <p>
          Hello, my name is Nick Julander.
          <br>
          <br>
          In May 2021 I will earn my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from
          the University of Colorado Boulder, and, as you can tell by this subpar
          website, I am beginning my journey as an up-and-coming Software Engineer.
          My ambition is to work anywhere where I can conquer new and exciting problems.
          More and more I find that I am most at ease when I am faced with a difficult
          software challenge. There is something about the sensibility, simplicity,
          and satisfaction of solving problems in the realm of computer science
          that is more entertaining than South Park; so, I feel extremely fortunate
          to have found my passion and future career. I hope that I can use my knowledge
          to assert myself as an impressive Software Engineer and that I am able to improve
          the world by providing intelligent solutions.
